    - Carrots
    - Open, sunny, well drained.
    - Grows well in an open, well drained area. Vegetable grows well in most reasonable
      garden soil, be sure to remove the majority of stones. Dig in approximately
      two inches of compost, and space seeds in rows 1-4 inches apart and about 1/4
      inches deep. Water regularly and keep weeded. Plant grows best when seeded between
      April and mid July.
    - For baby vegetables pull the whole plant when they are 3/4 inch thick. Larger
      ones can be harvested at any time. Wash the dirt off by immersing in a bucket
      filled with water.
    - ! 'bean, leek, onion, pea, radish, tomato. '
    - strawberry, tomato, grape
    - Water regularly, preferably with drip irrigation.
    - Carrot fly (use remay; make sure it is secure to the ground using wood or rocks).
      Overhead watering attracts the fly.

    - Beans
    - Open, sunny area
    - Grows best in an open sunny area. Before planting dig in a few inched of horse
      manure or compost. Space stakes in rows approximately 3 inches from one another,
      placing 5 to 8 seeds at the bottom of each stake. Keep plants weeded, especially
      while small.
    - Pick your string or snap varieties every few days by pulling the pod with one
      hand while holding the plant with the other. Do not harvest if plants are wet
      as they will not store well. Smaller vegetables taste more tender. Dried varieties
      need to be harvested when the plant has matured fully. Shell the pods, then
      make sure they are thoroughly dried before storing them.
    - ! 'beet, cabbage, carrot, corn, squash, tomato. '
    - chive, fennel, garlic, leek
    - Do not water seeds until they have sprouted. Water regularly after that.
    - These plants need good air circulation. Do not harvest or work around them when
      plants are wet, this may spread disease.

    - Corn
    - Well drained, sunny hillside.
    - Seeds grow best in a well drained sunny environment. Dig in 1 inch of compost
      before planting. Space seeds in rows approximately 4 to 6 inches apart, and
      plant about 1 inch deep. Plant seed near the end of May (or when temperatures
      are warm). Water regularly; plant soybeans between corn plants once they are
      about an inch high.
    - Once the cob is falling away from the stalk it is ready to harvest. Pull the
      cob downward and twist until it breaks away form the stalk.

    - Cucumbers
    - Needs good drainage. Can be grown outside or in greenhouse.
    - Grows best in warm, rich, well drained soil. Cucumbers require support, therefore
      staking would be beneficial. Space stakes 6 inches, and plant approximately
      3 seeds at the bottom of each stake. Be sure to soak seeds in water before planting.
      Cucumbers also require alot of watering, so be sure to water them daily by hand
      rather than sprinkling.
    - When plants are 6-12 inches long cut the fruit with a knife. It you twist it
      off you may break the stalk which may kill the plant. Harvest in the morning
      when it is cool. Picking when young will encourage more fruit.
    - ! "bean, broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, pea, radish, tomato\r\n"
    - sage
    - Need lots of water, deep watering rather than frequent sprinkles is best. If
      weather is warm water every second day if plants are in the greenhouse.
    - ! "If diseased do not compost plants.\r\nAphids – control when first appear,
      by spraying with water."

    - Eggplant
    - Well drained, sunny, warm location.
    - Plants grow best in well watered, warm areas. Be sure to plant in well composted
      soil to ensure nutrients. Plant seeds in rows, roughly 12 inches apart and about
      1 inch deep. Be sure to water often (approx. 2x daily) and keep seeded while
      small.
    - Fruit should be gathered when the surface is very glossy, and before it begins
      to assume a dull finish. Cut fruit with a knife leaving a 1/2 inch of stem,
      do not pull or twist.

    - Onions
    - Moist (not wet) location that is also well-drained and reasonably free from
      stones.
    - Onions grow well in areas that are moist and reasonably free of stone. Plant
      seeds in 3 to 4 inches of compost, and place seeds 4 to 6 inches apart, planting
      about 5 seeds in each hole. During the early stages water about 2 times per
      day, and stop watering once the tops of the plants begin to turn brown.
    - As the plants mature, the tops will fall to the ground. When 25-50% of the tops
      fall over, lay the rest down with a rake to hasten bulbs to maturity. After
      a day or two, pull the bulbs and spread out on the ground in the sun and allow
      them to remain there for 2 days. Then cut the tops an inch above the bulbs.
    - ! "beet, cabbage, carrot, lettuce, potato, tomato\r\n"
    - bean, peas
    - During early stages they require an abundance of water. Do not water once tops
      start turning brown (early August).
    - Very few diseases. Use rotation and destroy any plants that are infected.

    - Bell Peppers
    - Very sunny, well drained and open.
    - First, the seeds need to germinate (meaning, become sprouts) indoors in pots
      at temperatures above 70 degrees F. They will need about 8-10 weeks. Put fertilizer
      in your garden soil a week before moving seedlings from pots to the outdoors.
      When there is no danger of frost, grow in a sunny, well drained area with loamy
      soil (meaning it is equal parts sand, clay, and gravel). The soil should not
      be too rich. Plant seedlings 12 inches apart or in pairs. The bell peppers will
      mature in 50 to 70 days.
    - When fruit is firm it is ready to pick; fruit will ripen further to red or yellow
      skin; once they are harvested more fruit will form.
    - basil, carrot, onion, oregano, marjoram

    - Need to have regular watering during early stage of growth, once the plant is
      established less water is needed.

    - ! "First, seeds need to germinate (meaning, become sprouts) indoors at temperatures
      between 55 and 60 ° F for 2 to 4 weeks. It is okay to seed any time between
      one week after the last spring frost to midsummer. \r\nPut fertilizer into soil
      before planting. Plant seeds 1 inch deep and 2 to 3 feet apart in full sun in
      moist but well drained soil. Be careful not to damage root ball as the sprouts
      are transplanted. \r\nThe squash will mature 60 days after planting. Be sure
      to cut off the squash instead of breaking it off."
    - ! 'Summer (zucchini): fruit grows quickly so harvest every few days. When fruit
      is 8 inches long cut with a knife 2 inches from the end of the fruit; do not
      twist off or you can harm the plant.  Winter: harvest when skin is hard; if
      your thumbnail does not leave a mark on the skin they are ready to harvest.
      Cure by leaving fruit in the sun for a few days; turn every few hours and cover
      if left out at night.'

    - Open, sunny area
    - Plant seeds to germinate (meaning, grow into sprouts) indoors 6 to 8 weeks before
      the average last spring frost date. Two weeks before transplanting, mix in fertilizer
      into the soil. Plant after last frost date. Establish stakes in the soil at
      the time of planting and plant two feet apart. Pinch off a few of the lower
      branches on transplants, and plant the root ball deep enough so that the lowest
      leaves are just above the surface of the soil. Water well immediately after
      planting to reduce shock to the plant.
    - Pick fruits that firm and red, yellow or any other color the variety may be.
      Green fruit can be harvested and will ripen inside your house.
    - asparagus, basil, cabbage, carrot, onion, parsley, peas, sage
    - fennel, potato
    - Water deeply when weather is hot. If the fruit is splitting it is a sign they
      are not getting enough water.
    - Keep covered after July to avoid blight.

      If you plan on cooking with your basil, do not use fertilizers that leave harmful
      residues. Make sure to pick the leaves during the summer to encourage growth.
      After 6 weeks, pinch off the center shoot to prevent early flowering. Cut off
      any flowers that grow. The best time to harvest is when the plants begin to
      bud.
